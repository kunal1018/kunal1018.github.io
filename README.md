# 🌐 Kunal Gandhi – Developer Portfolio

This is my **first personal portfolio website**, created to showcase who I am, the tools I use, and the projects I’ve built so far as a Computer Science student. It’s designed to be minimal, responsive, and easy to update as I grow.

While this version marks my starting point, a **new and improved version is currently in the works** — with plans to upgrade both the design and functionality in every way possible.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔹 React  
A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I used React to create reusable components and manage the dynamic parts of the website (like the project list and navigation).

### 🔹 TypeScript  
A typed superset of JavaScript that catches errors during development and improves code readability. TypeScript was used to help me write more reliable code with better structure.

### 🔹 Vite  
A modern frontend build tool that offers lightning-fast development and optimized production builds. Vite was chosen for its speed and simplicity when working with React and TypeScript.

### 🔹 Tailwind CSS  
A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS. It helped me style the site responsively while keeping the codebase clean and consistent.

### 🔹 GitHub Pages  
A free hosting platform directly integrated with GitHub. The site is deployed using GitHub Pages for quick and easy access online.
